			  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			  <div class="well">
			  	<p>
			      Q: Will anyone I list as a crush be able to see that I did so?<br />
			      <span>A: No. Unless that person has ranked you as well, they will never see that you listed them.</span>
			    </p>

			    <p>
			      Q: Can anyone on the MatchSIXTEEN team see who I've listed as my crushes?<br />
			      <span>A: No. We've created a system that automatically performs matches for you. No one will ever be able to see your list besides you!</span>
			    </p>

			    <p>
			      Q: Why is the MatchSIXTEEN team collecting survey data?<br />
			      <span>A: To add a some depth to this tradition, We thought it would be interesting to learn a little about Stanford's academic and extracurricular social circles and how that impacts matches. Your participation in data collection is <u>totally optional</u> and <u>completely anonymous</u> (to us, your matches, and everyone else). After Match16 submissions close, we plan to release aggregate statistics about these social groups to y'all (making sure that no one can trace the anonymous data to you). If you are uncomfortable releasing this anonymous information, please select "Prefer Not to Answer" for each question.</span>
			    </p>

			    <p>
			      Q: Why is the MatchSIXTEEN team collecting intention behind preferences data?<br />
			      <span>A: By putting down your intention for each match, we can learn more about how people in our class played Match16. The intentions you put down do not effect who you match with and if you get a match, the person you matched with will not be able to see your intention and you will not be able to see theirs. Furthermore, your intention data will be anonymized and the MatchSIXTEEN team won't be able to see who you are.</span>
			    </p>

			    <p>
			      Q: How do I get in touch with the person once there's a match?<br />
			      <span>A: We'll provide you with the name and the rest is up to you! Most email addresses are available on stanfordwho.stanford.edu. Or just strike up a conversation with them! Sorry we didn't have time to build date planning into the system as well but we're sure you're more than capable</span>
			    </p>

			    <p>
			      Q: Do I have to hook up with someone if we match?<br />
			      <span>A: No, of course not. Do what you please. Keep it as casual or as seductive as you'd like. All this is is a chance for you to find out if someone you're interested in has any interest back. Take it from there.</span>
			    </p>

			    <p>
			      Q: What is this ranking system? Does the rank I give someone or the rank they give me matter?<br />
			      <span>A: No. Ranking does not matter at all. Just list 16 people you'd be stoked to find out are interested in you. If you list someone in your top 16 and they list you somewhere in their top 16, you'll both get a match email when results are released. Neither of you will ever know what rank you gave each other relative to your other crushes. The ranking feature is just a feature designed to make it easier for you to think about who your top 16 are.</span>
			    </p>

			    <p>
			      Q: What if I have more than one match?<br />
			      <span>A: Well then, aren't you a lucky duck? #firstworldmatchproblems</span>
